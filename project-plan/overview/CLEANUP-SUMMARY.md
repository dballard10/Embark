## New Information Architecture

### 📊 Single Source of Truth Principle

Each type of information now has ONE primary location:

| Information Type              | Primary Location                   | Referenced From                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tier tables, colors, formulas | tier-system-reference.md           | core-features, future-features |
| Quest system details          | features/quests.md                 | core-features, future-features |
| Item system details           | features/items.md                  | core-features, future-features |
| Glory/XP mechanics            | features/glory-xp.md               | core-features, future-features |
| Champion customization        | features/champion-customization.md | future-features                |
| Custom tier icon concepts     | tier-system-reference.md           | future-features                |
| Database schema               | data-models.md                     | All files                      |
| UI components & design        | ui-components.md                   | All files                      |
