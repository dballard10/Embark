# Embark - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

Embark is a gamified activity platform that transforms real-world hobbies and challenges into an engaging RPG-style experience. Users complete quests, earn rewards, collect items, level up their character, and compete with friends‚Äîall while exploring new activities and pushing their comfort zones.

## Core Concept

- **Real-World Integration**: Users complete physical activities (build a Lego set, solve a Rubik's cube, visit a new location)
- **Gamification Layer**: Earn Glory and XP, collect items with rarity tiers, level up characters
- **AI-Powered Content**: Quests generated using LLMs based on user preferences, location, and skill level
- **Social Elements**: Friends can complete group quests together
- **Progression System**: From Novice quests to legendary Conqueror challenges

## Target Platform

- **MVP**: React web app (TypeScript + React + Vite)
- **Future**: Native iOS app

## Key Differentiators

1. **Personalized Quests**: AI generates activities based on user location, interests, and skill level
2. **Flexible Difficulty**: Quests range from Novice (hours) to Conqueror (months) tier challenges
3. **Dual Progression**: Earn Glory (currency) and XP (experience) with 6-tier quest difficulty system
4. **Tangible Rewards**: Visual item collection system with matching rarity tiers (Common to Godly)
5. **Real-World Impact**: Encourages users to try new hobbies and step outside comfort zones

## Success Metrics
